What Happened to the A.I. Election? + ChatGPT for Mayor + The Productivity Tools We’re Using,2024-08-23 09:04:32+00:00,"By Kevin Roose, Casey Newton, Rachel Cohn, Whitney Jones, Jen Poyant, Daniel Ramirez, Dan Powell, Marion Lozano, Pat McCusker and Rowan Niemisto",Podcasts,"“It’s happening, but people don’t want it public.”","This week, we discuss why so few campaigns seem to be experimenting with A.I. The Times’s Sheera Frenkel joins us with examples of the many different artificial intelligence products that have been turned down by campaigns in this election cycle, from A.I.-generated endorsements from long-dead historical figures to a synthetic version of Donald Trump. Then, we interview the Wyoming man who ran for mayor on the promise that he would exclusively use a customized ChatGPT bot to run the city. And finally, it’s time for a tech check.
